# 2 Dimensional Arrays
Experiment 8


## AIM
To study and implement 2 Dimensional arrays in C++

## Theory
A 2D array is a data structure that with a grid, where each element is identified by two indices: a row index and a column index.  

```cpp
int matrix[3][4] = {
    {1, 2, 3, 4},
    {5, 6, 7, 8},
    {9, 10, 11, 12}
};
```

**Features of 2D array:**  


- Indexing: Elements in a 2D array are accessed using two indices.
- Contiguous Memory: In C++, a 2D array is stored in memory as a continuous block of memory.
